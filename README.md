  <p>Yup, I am that one gray horse.</p>
  <small>You just saw me with a cosplay skin, hohoho.</small>
<hr>
  <p>Name's Kevin or Kenhor≈ç, but feel free to call me with the name of the character you met me.
 <br> | 20 years old | purpleblood | bard of light | prospit dreamer |</p>
<p>I love both Gamzee and Kanaya and I make them love each other in the most queerplatonic way possible <3 <abbr title="pls do it, make me talk about them...">(but don't make me talk about them)</abbr>
<hr>
<p>Feel free to cuddle and hide (C+H) with any of my ponies!!.
<br>No need to talk to me to snuggle! but it's appreciated.</p>
<p>I don't roleplay usually, but it's worth a try, just, no shipping stuff if possible, mostly because my asexual ass doesn't know how shippy roleplays works.
